# Guess-game
A simple game in which the user picks a number in their head and the script guesses until it is correct.

The script simply guesses a number and the user has 3 options, to say whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low, and the script will continue guessing until it finds the correct number.

Very simple game that took less than an hour to create, but good practice in object-oriented programming that I enjoyed doing.

To run, simply download python and run the module within IDLE.
